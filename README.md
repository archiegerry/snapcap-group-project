The 'demos' folder contains the three iteration demo videos, as well as the final showcase.

# HOW TO OPERATE SNAPCAP:

Any videos to be played can be placed in the 'videos' folder for easy access.
-> These should be .wmv if on Windows, or .mov if on Linux.

Within Qt Creator, GCC compiler should be used for the best results.
Working directory should be moved to the main code folder, i.e. ...\user_interfaces_cwk3
One command line arg should be supplied: the location of the video folder
-> In this case, "./videos/" 

# Enjoy!
